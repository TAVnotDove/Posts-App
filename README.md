# Posts-App
My Angular project for SoftUni's regular exam.

After cloning the repository, you need to open
the angular-project folder and install
the necessary node modules with the command
`npm i`

After that, you need to get inside the server folder
`cd .\server\`
and run the js file inside it with node
`node .\server.js`

Lastly, you need to start the Angular app with the command
`ng s`

It is a blog-type website with user authentication and posts CRUD. [WIP]
